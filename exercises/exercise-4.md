# Exercise 4

1. Refactor repetitive code into functions. Define the functions at the top and in the same file.

2. Remove the result variable.

3. Write a function which calculates the result using the history. The function should have no print statements in it. Call the function from within the command while loop to get the result and display it.

4. Upgrade the history command to display the number of adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides in the history. Display this below the history table when the history command is executed. Apply the various language features learned to make the code as well organized as possible.
